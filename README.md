Single-page web apps using Angular and Node.js with Express.

# Running the application
- running 'npm install' and 'bower install' will install all dependencies
- mongoDB must be either running locally, or configured by adding config > settings.json with a mongolab URI
- I have a live version of the app up at https://calm-citadel-6847.herokuapp.com

# About the app
- I used AngularJS, created custom controllers and services, used Node.js with Express to handle routing, and MongoDB for the database (rather than stubbing out the data as if it were an API response).
